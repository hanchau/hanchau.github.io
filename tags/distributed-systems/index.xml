      <description>Introduction In the last post I discussed why we need distributed systems and how to setup gearman on a cluster. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to convince you that CAP theorem is indeed a &amp;ldquo;theorem&amp;rdquo;. Anyways, We like distributed systems!! (because they provide us the features that we really want) but&amp;hellip;, Are they trivial to implement?.
Words of Wisdom!! My colleague once said
More code =&amp;gt; More Complexity =&amp;gt; More Monster Bugs =&amp;gt; More Pain  Fundamental Operations Let&amp;rsquo;s start with that, Initially we used to have a beautiful piece of machine having 8 cores, 16 gigs of memory, few hundread gigs of storage.</description>

      <description>What are Distributed Systems? In the last post I gave a brief about the concept of parallel processing through some examples. Now we know how to make our systems more parallel in nature, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time learn the concept of distributed processing, how it&amp;rsquo;s different from parallel processing and how to integrate it in our existing projects. There are lots of definitions of Distributed System but I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the one I like the most which is obviously mine (HAHA).</description>
